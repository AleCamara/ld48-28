INTRODUCTION

I was born different. While normal people can have all colours, I can only get one.

When I was a kid I was so angry with my condition that I HAD to learn a trick.

Now if I scowl in a certain way, I can strain my eyes to a point I can see other colours.

Unfortunately, I'm still cursed to see only one colour at a time. It still feels like walking through walls all the time.



MY DREAM

I won't be able to reach my dream: be an adventurer.

I won't be able to climb the highest mountain on Earth or to explore the deepest chasm of the ocean.

I won't be able to cross the largest desert.

I won't be able to fight and tame horrible beasts from the darkest jungles.

I won't be able to get to the moon nor other planets!

DAMN IT! I WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO FALL IN LOVE!

It's not that these things are easy for anyone, but for me they are IMPOSSIBLE!



TRAGEDY

I hate my eyes. I hate my fate! But especially...

... I hate the kid I was! Why would he learn this useful scowl-trick that only remind me of what I'm missing!

Bah. It's no use getting mad for this. I'll get back home and keep doing what I'm best at:

(special level in which player just falls)
Nothing.



FINAL
(just text, no gameplay)

Well, isn't that funny?

While he was complaining all the time about his "inability" to make his dream come true...

.. he didn't realised that he was making it real.

Sometimes we are all that prevents us from making our dreams come true.
